# Firebase/NodeMCU Pulse Monitor

## Overview

This project utilizes a basic pulse sensor to measure the user's pulse rate. The collected data is then converted into a continuous stream of JSON data, which is transmitted to the Firebase Realtime Database. The frontend application can later access and process this data for further analysis and presentation.

## How It Works

1. **Pulse Measurement**: The system employs a simple pulse sensor to accurately measure the user's pulse rate.

2. **Data Conversion**: The measured pulse rate is converted into a structured JSON format, facilitating seamless integration with the Firebase Realtime Database.

3. **Firebase Integration**: The JSON data stream is sent to the Firebase Realtime Database in real-time, ensuring up-to-date and accessible information.

4. **Frontend Application**: The frontend application is designed to retrieve and process the stored data from the Firebase Realtime Database. This allows for a user-friendly representation and analysis of the pulse rate information.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Hardware Requirements**: Ensure that you have the necessary hardware components, including a NodeMCU and a pulse sensor.

2. **Software Dependencies**: Install the required software dependencies as outlined in the project documentation.

3. **Firebase Configuration**: Set up a Firebase project and configure the credentials to enable communication between the NodeMCU and the Firebase Realtime Database.

4. **Connect Components**: Follow the provided instructions to properly connect and configure the pulse sensor with the NodeMCU.

5. **Deploy Frontend App**: Deploy the frontend application to visualize and analyze the pulse rate data stored in the Firebase Realtime Database.
