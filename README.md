# LifeBeat

LifeBeat is an innovative IT solution composed of two parts: an electronic patch that measures vital health parameters such as blood pressure and heart rate, and a mobile application that saves this data. The application uses an AI model to monitor the user's health and predict potential heart attacks or chronic illnesses.

## Features

The main features of the LifeBeat mobile application include:

- Real-time logging of health data
- Alerts in case of health disorders
- Tips for disease prevention and better lifestyle
- Prediction of chronic diseases in early stages of development

## Technologies

The AI model is developed using Python, leveraging technologies such as neural networks and libraries like Pandas and Keras. The mobile application is developed in Kotlin.

The AI model is trained on a large database, enabling it to predict illnesses based on the health measures sent by the patch.
